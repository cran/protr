# protr 1.6-0 (2019-02-11)

## Bug Fixes

- Updated `twoGOSim()` and `parGOSim()` to use the latest `GOSemSim` API for computing GO based semantic similarity. Issues in the code examples are also fixed. We thank Denisa Duma for the feedback.

# protr 1.5-2 (2018-11-21)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed the API endpoint issue (from HTTP to HTTPS) in `getUniProt()`.

## Improvements

- Added two new parameters `gap.opening` and `gap.extension` to `parSeqSim()`, allowing more flexible tuning of the sequence alignment for more types of amino acid sequence data. We thank Dr. Maisa Pinheiro for the feedback.
- Added floating TOC and new CSS style in the vignette to improve navigation and readability.

# protr 1.5-1 (2018-07-12)

## New Features

- Added a new function `removeGaps()` for removing/replacing gaps (`-`) or any irregular characters from protein sequences, to make them suitable for feature extraction or sequence alignment based similarity computation. We thank Dr. Maisa Pinheiro for the feedback.

# protr 1.5-0 (2017-11-17)

## Bug Fixes

- Resolved a critical bug due to improper `ifelse` conditioning ([3f6e106](https://github.com/road2stat/protr/commit/3f6e106c93ab9f28c532547f68b3cd9d5cc3d9b4)) for the distribution descriptor in CTD. We thank Jielu Yan from the University of Macau for kindly reporting this issue.

## Improvements
