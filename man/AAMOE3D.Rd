3D Descriptors for 20 Amino Acids calculated by MOE 2011.10
}
\details{
This dataset includes the 3D descriptors of the 20 amino
acids calculated by MOE 2011.10 used for scales extraction
in this package. All amino acid molecules had also been
optimized with MOE (semiempirical AM1) before calculating
these 3D descriptors. The SDF file containing the
information of the optimized amino acid molecules is
included in this package. See \code{\link{OptAA3d}} for
more information.
