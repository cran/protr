## Introduction

The protr package aims for protein sequence feature extraction, which could be easily applied in Bioinformatics and Chemogenomics research. The package is developed by Computational Biology and Drug Design Group, Central South University.

## Protein Sequence Features

The protein sequence features listed in this package include

  * Amino Acid Composition
  
    * Amino Acid Composition
    * Dipeptide Composition
    * Tripeptide Composition

  * Autocorrelation
  
    * Normalized Moreau-Broto Autocorrelation
    * Moran Autocorrelation
    * Geary Autocorrelation

  * CTD
  
    * Composition
    * Transition
    * Distribution

  * Conjoint Triad

  * Quasi-sequence-order Descriptors
  
    * Sequence-order-coupling Number
    * Quasi-sequence-order Descriptors
  
  * Pseudo Amino Acid Composition
